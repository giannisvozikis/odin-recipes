    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) package gemelli pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons herb-infused extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups 1% milk</li>
        <li>⅔ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded provolone cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook gemelli in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat herb-infused olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Cook and stir onion in hot oil for 2 minutes. Add asparagus and mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to soften and asparagus is bright green, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour vegetable mixture into a large bowl. Stir in cooked pasta until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture bubbles, about 4 minutes. Pour in milk, stirring briskly to avoid lumps. Continue to stir until sauce thickens and bubbles again, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano and provolone until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce over pasta-vegetable mixture and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Toss remaining 1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano with bread crumbs in a small bowl and sprinkle over casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
