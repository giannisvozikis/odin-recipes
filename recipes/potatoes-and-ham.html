    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chopped hickory smoked ham</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish with butter.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in flour and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Pour in half-and-half and milk; whisk until sauce is thickened, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper. Stir in garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Place 1/2 of the sliced potatoes into the prepared baking dish; top with 3/4 cup ham. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese. Pour in 1/2 of the sauce from the skillet. Repeat layering the remaining potatoes, 3/4 cup ham, 1/4 cup Cheddar, 1/4 cup Monterey Jack, and sauce. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until cheese is golden and sauce is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
